# Team Crites

Team Crites comprises the upper echelon of Mobiquity web developers -- without question.  To be a part of Team Crites means to eat, sleep, and breathe JavaScript.  A Team Crites developer's strength extends beyond his platform. We all have the potential to be teachers, architects, leaders, managers, and anything we can dream of. This is true not only because of our talent but because of our loyalty to each other and willingness to teach each other.

The following are guidelines for being a fruitful member of Team Crites. I encourage you to follow these guidelines, and I will consistently follow up with them as well.

## Requirements

Being a member of team Crites has several innate requirements.

<ol start=0>
<li><a href=https://github.com/ajcrites>Andrew Crites</a> subjects himself to *at least* the same standards as all other teammates</li></ol>
1. We are leaders and teachers in our platform.  Participate in the #javascript channel on Slack as frequently as you can. Participation in other channels is encouraged -- particularly with respect to technologies you are passionate about. At least once every two weeks is a good minimum ... once a week is a good metric.  No contribution is too small or too stupid. Participation may include
 * Asking questions
 * Submitting blog posts (you've read or written)
 * Starting or participating in discussions -- even inflammatory ones
 * Code samples, especially repos or gists.
  *[`gistup-norepo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gistup-norepo) makes creating gists easy!
  * Mobiquity project code samples/questions are acceptable. We are all under NDA.
 * Sharing new technologies, especially ones you have worked with or are curious about.
 * Anything else you can think of.
2. Blogging is important, but it can be difficult.  At least one thoughtful blog post every couple months is encouraged.  This can be entirely extraneous to work and even technology.  Blog about TV, politics, nature, or whatever you are passionate about. Obviously, blogging about software is perfectly applicable.
 * Ask me if you want help setting up a blog or get writer's block.
3. Contributing to open source is a requirement for any modern developer. Team Crites members will contribute to open source projects at least a couple times a month. *Any* open source project is an acceptable target, and you should share your contributions to the team. You may participate in a variety of ways:
 * Pull requests (the king of contributions)
 * Creating issues / testing
 * Improving documentation
4. Participation on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a personal passion of mine. I expect *all* members of Team Crites to maintain active Stackoverflow accounts.  I encourage you to participate as much as possible, but minimaly you should contribute a post (question or answer) at least a couple times a month.
 * Ask me if you have questions about participating in Stackoverflow
 * Asking a question you already know the answer to -- and even answering it -- is acceptable.  This still helps the community.
 * Questions you arrive at from working on client projects make perfect Stackoverflow questions.
 * Asking a question on SO does not preclude you from asking on #javascript and vice versa
5. Team Crites will maintain at least one active open source project. All members are encouraged to actively contribute in their free time in any way possible. This includes coming up with ideas / design / QA / documentation, and of course, coding. There are no hard requirements for this -- we do it because we love it.
6. Above all else, Team Crites members will make client work a priority. We will be desired as developers on projects above any other developer in the organization -- even the world!
