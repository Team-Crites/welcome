# Team Crites

Team Crites comprises the upper echelon of Mobiquity web developers -- *without question*.  To be a part of Team Crites means to eat, sleep, and breathe JavaScript.  A Team Crites developer's strength extends beyond his platform. We all have the potential to be teachers, architects, leaders, managers, and anything we can dream of. This is true not only because of our talent but because of our loyalty to each other and willingness to teach each other.

We're all stunners, studs, superstars, slayers, and *legends*.

The following are guidelines for being a fruitful member of Team Crites. I encourage you to follow these guidelines, and I will consistently follow up with them as well.

## Requirements

Being a member of team Crites has several innate requirements.

<ol start=0>
<li><a href=https://github.com/ajcrites>Andrew Crites</a> subjects himself to *at least* the same standards as all other teammates</li></ol>
1. We are leaders and teachers in our platform.  Participate in the #javascript channel on Slack as frequently as you can. Participation in other channels is encouraged -- particularly with respect to technologies you are passionate about. At least once every two weeks is a good minimum ... once a week is a good metric.  No contribution is too small or too stupid. Participation may include
 * Asking questions
 * Submitting blog posts (you've read or written)
 * Starting or participating in discussions -- even inflammatory ones
 * Code samples, especially repos or gists.
  *[`gistup-norepo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gistup-norepo) makes creating gists easy!
  * Mobiquity project code samples/questions are acceptable. We are all under NDA.
 * Sharing new technologies, especially ones you have worked with or are curious about.
 * Anything else you can think of.
2. Blogging is important, but it can be difficult.  At least one thoughtful blog post every couple months is encouraged.  This can be entirely extraneous to work and even technology.  Blog about TV, politics, nature, or whatever you are passionate about. Obviously, blogging about software is perfectly applicable.
 * Ask me if you want help setting up a blog or get writer's block.
3. Contributing to open source is a requirement for any modern developer. Team Crites members will contribute to open source projects at least a couple times a month. *Any* open source project is an acceptable target, and you should share your contributions to the team. You may participate in a variety of ways:
 * Pull requests (the king of contributions)
 * Creating issues / testing
 * Improving documentation
4. Participation on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a personal passion of mine. I expect *all* members of Team Crites to maintain active Stackoverflow accounts.  I encourage you to participate as much as possible, but minimaly you should contribute a post (question or answer) at least a couple times a month.
 * Ask me if you have questions about participating in Stackoverflow
 * Asking a question you already know the answer to -- and even answering it -- is acceptable.  This still helps the community.
 * Questions you arrive at from working on client projects make perfect Stackoverflow questions.
 * Asking a question on SO does not preclude you from asking on #javascript and vice versa
5. Team Crites will maintain at least one active open source project. All members are encouraged to actively contribute in their free time in any way possible. This includes coming up with ideas / design / QA / documentation, and of course, coding. There are no hard requirements for this -- we do it because we love it.
6. Testing, testing, testing! Team Crites developers will be leaders with respect to automated testing. `We didn't have time to write tests` is a phrase that confounds us.
7. **Above all else**, Team Crites members will make client work a priority. We will be desired as developers on projects above any other developer in the organization -- even the world!

## What you get from me

This is an incomplete list of what I want to offer to Team Crites

* Talk to me about anything -- no topic is off limits
 * I am never too busy to meet with any of you individually or as a group
* I will help with any projects -- client, open source, or personal -- in any way that I can
* I *want* you to succeed in your requirements, so I will work to make sure that you do
* **I am not above criticism** -- as a developer or a manager

## What I want from you

Ultimately, I want you to be better developers than I am. While this is personal, I want you to help the team!

* All Team Crites members will treat others with respect
 * No one is above a job.
 * Correct someone when they are in error. This does not devalue them.
 * Discussion is important. There are many solutions to a problem.
* Team Crites members will be models in the Gainesville office. I would like you all to be good stewards and regularly maintain your areas / common areas you use. When we all work together to do this, it makes the job easier.
* We will work to improve the office as a whole -- aesthetically and functionally -- as best we can.
* We will be teachers in the office. MobTalks, meetups, and Slack participation with some regularity are all strongly encouraged.
* Healthy competition! I want you all to make each other work for the next goal. Show up your teammate and then wait for him to improve on what you did and show you up. I can't wait to participate in this too.
 * This is a *terrible* example that no one will get, but I've though about it for a long time. In [Breath of Fire 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breath_of_Fire_IV) there is an enemy called the `Lavoid`. If you hit a `Lavoid` with :fire: attacks, it gets exponentially stronger. I think of myself as a `Lavoid`, and I want you all to be `Lavoid`s.  That is to say, when someone improves on your code, you take that and you make it even better. Then, someone comes in and makes that better. We asymptotically improve each other until we're all so strong that it becomes overwhelming to challenge us.
* **Never** have someone complain to me about you. I only want to hear compliments about you from others. This is a lot to ask, but I personally believe you can all fulfill this.

If you are ever overwhelmed in any way, you can talk to me about that too. You are all capable, and I feel you should be comfortable in your jobs. You should be excelling. I'm striving to make you succeed, and I want to combat any obstacles with you.

## The Fun Stuff

I want us to make being a member of Team Crites an enviable position. Let's organize and participate in:

* Community outreach
* Software meetups
* Sports activities
* Cultural explorations
* Competitions
* Parties

I have very strict and tough requirements for each of you that I know you can excel. On the other hand, I want (optional) fun to be available to all of you in your personal lives, and I want you to be fulfilled in them as well. ***Let's go Team Crites!***

## Wisdom

Here are some palliative cliches that I've clung to as I've progressed as a software developer:

> The only ones who never fail are those who never try

We all screw up sometimes. You'll never get a story out of "I decided not to do it." -- As long as it's not criminal.

> He who asks is a fool for five minutes.  He who does not ask remains a fool forever.

It's better to be vulnerable and admit you don't know something so that you can learn it rather than go through life not understanding it. *I will personally* defend someone who admits they don't know something in the face of criticism.

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough

Inside of every well written large program is a well written small program. Understanding things takes time. Being able to explain something properly is an science, and the distillation of difficult concepts is an art. Writing  systems that are simpler to consume is more complex and difficult than writing more complicated systems in many cases.

> On two occasions I have been asked, "Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?" ... I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

One of my favorite quotes from the *original* computer scientist. People think computers are magical. They aren't. Let's keep trying to convince them that they are.
